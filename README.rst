The demo provides an example FPGA design containing a sensor and a crypto-core communicating with C command prompt application
that runs on the SoC. The demo is able to capture the side-channel leakage and transmit it via UART.

The demo provides a protocol to communicate side-channel data for evaluation purposes.
The exact standard is detailed here and can be reused to build your own C acquisition application.
